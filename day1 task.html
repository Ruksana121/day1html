<h1>Full Stack Application</h1>
<h2>Frontend Technologies</h2>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is used to create the structure of a webiste.</p>
<p>It is acts a s skeleton and used to create the web pages.</p>
<p>It consists of series of elements which is represented by tage and it invented by "Tim bernerslee" in the year 1991 and officially invented by 1993.</P>
<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>CSS stands for Cascading Styling Sheets</p>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents, describing how a webpage should look by prescribing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS provides developers and designers with powerful control over the presentation of HTML elements.</p>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.</p>
<h2>Backend Technologies</h2>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Python is an easy to interpret and high-level object-oriented programming language with easy-to-read syntax. Ideal for prototyping and ad-hoc tasks, Python has wide use in scientific computing, web development, and automation. As a general-purpose, beginner-friendly programming language, Python supports many top computer scientists and application developers globally.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc. in May 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices.</p>
<h3>Node.JS</h3>
<p>Node.js is a powerful, open-source, and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, making it ideal for building scalable server-side and networking applications. JavaScript was earlier mainly used for frontend development. With Node JS (Introduced in 2009), JavaScript became a backend language as well. Non-blocking, event-driven architecture for high performance. Supports the creation of REST APIs, real-time applications, and microservices. Comes with a rich library of modules through Node Package Manager.</p>
<h3>React.Js</h3>
<p>React is a JavaScript Library known for front-end development (or user interface). It is popular due to its component-based architecture, Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Virtual DOM for building web applications that are fast, efficient, and scalable. Applications are built using reusable components that enable the reload of only the changed part of the UI. Hence we get a better user experience with React. Allows you to describe how the UI should look based on the state of your application. Uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates, making applications faster and more efficient. Enforces a one-way data flow, making the application predictable and easier to debug. It uses JSX which combines HTML-like syntax with JavaScript's functionality, making it easy to shift to React from JavaScript.</P>
<h2>Database</h2>
<p>A database is an organized collection of data stored in a computer system and usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). The data in common databases is modeled in tables, making querying and processing efficient. Structured query language (SQL) is commonly used for data querying and writing.</P>
<h3>SQL</h3>
<p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It enables users to perform a variety of tasks such as querying data, creating and modifying database structures, and managing access permissions. SQL is widely used across various relational database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.</p>
<h3>MySQL</h3>
<p>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle Corporation.It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for database management and is known for its reliability, speed and ease of use.MySQL is widely used for various applications, from small websites to large-scale enterprise systems.</p>
<h3>MangoDb</h3>
<p>MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that is designed to store and retrieve large volumes of data efficiently.It is highly scalable, flexible, and widely used for building modern applications. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making it a popular choice for applications requiring a flexible data structure.</p>
